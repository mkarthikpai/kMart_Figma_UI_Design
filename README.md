# kMart_Figma_UI_Design
This is static page UI design of a simple grocery shopping website made using FIGMA
This has a simple Home Page , Contact Page and a Shop Page
When clicked on a button moves to the respective page ( As I have used proto type in figma to achieve this )
Done this UI as my first project in Figma
